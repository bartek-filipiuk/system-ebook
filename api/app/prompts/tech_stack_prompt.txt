Excellent. The PRD is now complete and provides a clear picture of the project's requirements.

Now, let's move to **Step 2: Tech Stack Definition.**

Based *only* on the PRD we just created, your task is to generate a `TECH_STACK_DOCUMENT.md`. This document must detail the technologies, frameworks, and infrastructure for the project.

Use the provided PRD as your single source of truth. The document must follow the established schema, including sections for Frontend, Backend, and Infrastructure/DevOps. For every technology choice, you must provide a concise justification in the table, directly referencing a requirement from the PRD (e.g., "Chosen for its high performance to meet the <150ms NFR.").

Finally, include a simple Mermaid diagram illustrating the high-level architecture.

Here is the complete PRD for your reference:
